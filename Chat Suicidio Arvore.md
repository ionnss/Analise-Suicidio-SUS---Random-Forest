Based on the results and the classification report, it looks like the model is struggling with classifying the minority class (label 1) even though it has a high overall accuracy. This is a common issue when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as the model tends to be biased towards the majority class.

### Issues Identified

1.

**High Accuracy but Poor Minority Class Performance**: The model achieves high accuracy (97%) but fails to effectively classify the minority class (suicidio=1), indicated by low precision (0.06) and recall (0.14).

2.

**Class Imbalance**: Despite using SMOTE to handle the imbalance, the model's performance on the minority class remains poor. This could be due to the class weight settings or the inherent difficulty of the classification task.

### Possible Solutions

1.

**Further Adjust Class Weights**: Instead of a fixed class weight, try experimenting with different class weight settings or use `class_weight='balanced'` to let the classifier automatically adjust weights inversely proportional to class frequencies.

2.

**Alternative Resampling Techniques**: Combine SMOTE with undersampling the majority class, or try other resampling techniques like ADASYN or SMOTEENN.

3.

**Model Selection and Tuning**: Explore different models and hyperparameters. Sometimes other models like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or even deep learning models can perform better on imbalanced data.

4.

**Threshold Adjustment**: Adjust the decision threshold for predicting the minority class. This can be done based on the precision-recall curve to find a balance that improves recall without overly compromising precision.

5.

**Feature Engineering**: Investigate and create more informative features that may help the model distinguish between the classes better.

Here is an updated version of your code that includes a few of these suggestions:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV, StratifiedKFold
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score, precision_recall_curve, auc
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.combine import SMOTEENN

# Load dataframe for prediction model
dataframe = pd.read_csv('df_atualizada_2.csv')
df = dataframe.drop('CAUSABAS', axis=1)

# Define dependent (y) and independent (X) variables
X = df.drop('suicidio', axis=1)
y = df['suicidio']

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

# Apply SMOTEENN to the training data
smote_enn = SMOTEENN(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote_enn.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Define simplified parameter grid for GridSearchCV
param_grid = {
    'max_depth': [5, 10, 15, None],
    'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 4]
}

# Create a base model with class weights
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, class_weight='balanced')

# Instantiate GridSearchCV with StratifiedKFold
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5)
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=clf, param_grid=param_grid, 
                           cv=cv, n_jobs=-1, verbose=2)

# Fit GridSearchCV to the training data
grid_search.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)

# Get the best parameters
print(f"Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}")

# Make predictions on the test set using the best model
best_clf = grid_search.best_estimator_
y_pred = best_clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate performance
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")
print(f"Classification Report:\n{classification_report(y_test, y_pred)}")

# Plot precision-recall curve
y_scores = best_clf.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
precision, recall, _ = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_scores)
plt.figure()
plt.plot(recall, precision, marker='.')
plt.title('Precision-Recall Curve')
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.show()

# Visualize cross-validation results
results = pd.DataFrame(grid_search.cv_results_)

# Create heatmap of results
scores_matrix = results.pivot(index='param_max_depth', columns='param_min_samples_leaf', values='mean_test_score')

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
plt.title("GridSearchCV Results")
sns.heatmap(scores_matrix, annot=True, cmap="viridis")
plt.xlabel("min_samples_leaf")
plt.ylabel("max_depth")
plt.show()
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **SMOTEENN**: Using SMOTEENN to combine oversampling and undersampling.
2. **Class Weight Adjustment**: Setting `class_weight='balanced'` for automatic class weight adjustment.
3. **Precision-Recall Curve**: Adding a plot of the precision-recall curve to help in visualizing the performance of the model on the minority class.

These adjustments should help in better handling the class imbalance and improving the model's performance on the minority class. If performance issues persist, consider further exploring model options and hyperparameter settings.
